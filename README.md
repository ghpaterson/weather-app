# Weather App

A simple browser weather app based on the users current location, giving current, hourly and daily weather forecasts. The app was built using JavaScript, HTML and basic CSS

## API

Open-Meteo (no api-key required)
https://open-meteo.com/en/docs#api_form

## Installation

Download and initialise the project:

```js
$ git clone https://github.com/ghpaterson/weather-app.git
$ cd weather-app
$ npm install
```

## Using the App

From the main project directory...

Start running the server in a new terminal using Vite:

```js
$ cd weather-app
$ npm run dev
```

The terminal will give you a local address that the server is running on, for example my local was given as http://localhost:5173/

Copy this into your browser. The app might take a few minutes to render but then will give you the current weather from your location.

NB! Make sure location services are enabled in your browser of choice.
